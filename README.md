## About

Hi! I am a web developer and data-vis with 10 years experience building websites and web
apps. While I have worked throughout the stack, my deep expertise is
on the frontend, especially **TypeScript** and
**React**. I also have special expertise with
**D3.js** and **ProseMirror**. I have an extensive background in public
speaking, and enjoy distilling technical subjects for a variety of
audiences.

## Work

I have a freelancing business [Living Pixel Solutions](https://livingpixel.io), where I work with clients to develop data intensive, interactive web apps.

Some things I've worked on: [Manuscripts.io](https://livingpixel.io/work/manuscripts), [Please Sign Me](https://www.pleasesign.me/), [Hypocube](https://hypocube.space/), [Abbey](https://abbey.girihlet.com/), [MitoViewer](https://mitoviewer.girihlet.com/), [GUS](https://www.soniatarabay.com/search/), [node-ncbi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-ncbi), and [many more](https://livingpixel.io/work).

I write a blog where I experiment with [data-vis stories and techniques](https://livingpixel.io/blog).
