I am a web application developer with 11 years of professional experience. While I have worked throughout the stack, my deep expertise is on the frontend, especially **TypeScript** and **React**. I also have special expertise with **D3.js** and **ProseMirror**. I have an extensive background in [public speaking](https://livingpixel.io/work#speaking), and enjoy distilling technical subjects for a variety of audiences.

I live in BC, Canada 🍁, with my wife and two daughters.
